You are given an array a of n positive integers.

You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer 1≤k≤n and do one of two things:

decrement by one k of the first elements of the array.
decrement by one k of the last elements of the array.
For example, if n=5 and a=[3,2,2,1,4], then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below):

decrement from the first two elements of the array. After this operation a=[2,1,2,1,4];
decrement from the last three elements of the array. After this operation a=[3,2,1,0,3];
decrement from the first five elements of the array. After this operation a=[2,1,1,0,3];
Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.




#include<stdio.h>
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    std::vector<int> v(n);
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	        cin>>v[i];
	    int leftmost = v[0];
	    for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--)
	    {
	        v[i] -= v[i-1];
	        if(v[i] < 0)
	            leftmost += v[i];
	    }
	    if(leftmost >= 0)
	     std::cout <<"YES"<< std::endl;
	     else
	     std::cout << "NO" << std::endl;
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
